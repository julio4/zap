#### ZAP Source

> Need to build a ZAP Source? Check out the [ZAP Source Guide](../guides/source)!

Currently, HTTP requests inside a proof is **NOT-SUPPORTED** by Mina.

We need a workaround: The _ZAP Sources_! They are a subset of the possible sources that can be used during the off-chain proof generation.
Source only refers to the HTTP endpoints used to fetch the data.

Zap Sources are web2 API. They expose endpoints that wraps specific HTTP requests and gets the result on behalf of the user.
The response is signed with a pair of keys.

This allow the user to make the HTTP request in an unsafe environment (outside of the proof) and use the response inside the proof.
During the verification, the ZAP Source public key is used to verify the signature of the response, thus emulating an HTTP request inside a proof.

Following the loan example, a `Bank` ZAP Source is deployed. The user makes a HTTP request to this source with his bank authentification token.
The ZAP source relays the request to the bank, and send back the response signed with its private key.
The user generate a proof that he has more than a specific amount on his bank account using the value returned by the source, and the proof is verified on-chain against the source public key.

> This is the only part where there is a privacy issue: The ZAP Source can see the user's bank account balance and authentification token.
> We are researching a solution to this problem and open to suggestions/ideas!

## Interface of a ZAP Source

Each request body must be of type `ZapRequestParams` and contain the `mina_address` of the user that made the request:

```typescript
export type ZapRequestParams = {
  mina_address: string;
  args?: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
};
```

The `args` object contains the arguments of the request. The `args` object is optional and can be omitted if the endpoint doesn't require any arguments.
The `path` of the request correspond to the full path of the endpoint, for example `/api/example/number`.

The `args` and `path` are used to sign the response with the source private key and ensure that the response is not tampered.
This can be represented as an object of type `Route`:

```typescript
export type Route = {
  path: string;
  args?: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
};
```

The returned value must be of type `SupportedValue` (currently, only `number` is supported), which is the data returned by the endpoint and that will be used inside the attestation and verified in the ZAP contract.
But this value must be wrapped in an object of type `ZapSignedResponse` with a signature of the response data with the source private key and the `hashRoute`.

That way, for a given Route, value and signature, we can verify that the value comes from the oracle of public key `P` by computing `hash(Route.path, Route.args)` and checking that `signature == sign({value, hash(Route.path, Route.args)}, P)`.

The definitive response is of type `ZapSignedResponse`:

```typescript
type ZapSignedResponse = {
    data: {
      value: number;
      hashRoute: hash(Route.path, Route.args);
    };
    signature: string;
    publicKey: string;
}
```

The express.js `zapMiddleware` of the source template can be used to automatically wrap `SupportedValue` responses in a `ZapSignedResponse` object. Follow the [ZAP Source Guide](../guides/source) for more information.
