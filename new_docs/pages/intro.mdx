This section aims to provides a high-level introduction to the use of Oracles on blockchain and how ZkOracles can solve some of the problems that are currently faced by Oracles.

If you are already familiar with ZkOracles, feel free to skip directly to the [ZAP Overview](./)

To make it easy to follow this introduction, we will take an example that will be used throughout this section: **Web3 loan with Web2 bank collatoral**.
An user would like to take a loan from a dApp with collateral from his Web2 bank account.
The dApp needs to verify his bank account balance on-chain, but the bank only provide a bank statement.

### Oracle

In the context of blockchains, an Oracle is a third-party service that brings external data to the blockchain.
They acts as a bridge between the blockchain, that operates within a closed environment, and the outside world.
Oracles are _interfaces_ to the real world.

However, Oracles on traditional blockchain comes with a few problems.

##### The Availability problem

As there are no way to predict at what specific time some data will be needed, Oracles need to continually update the state on the blockchain in order to stay available.

For example, to operate a price feed on Ethereum, the Oracle needs to pay the gas fees for each `update` transaction, even if there's no usage of the price feed at that moment.
This is exponentially expensive with the frequency of the update and with the size of the data.

##### The Cooperation problem

Oracle are a single point of trust, so it's crucial for users of an app to easily know what Oracle is used and what data is sent to it.
The most trustless way would be Oracles operated by their web2 counterpart, but almost all of them are not willing to cooperate.

In the case of the bank statement, the dApp would want to only trust the bank itself directly.
But we doubt that bank would be willing to operate an Oracle by themselve.

> For data that don't depend on a single source (i.e. a price feed), there is decentralized Oracles systems that allow multiple participants to ensure a maximal trustless setup. However this is currently not possible for most of the web2 data.

##### The Privacy problem

The last and most important point is that Oracle are not privacy-preserving: if an Oracle is used to provide some kind of data about a specific user, both the request and the response are public on the blockchain.

In the context of the loan, if the bank operates an Oracle that provides the bank account balance of a user, the user's bank account balance would be public on the blockchain.

### ZkOracles

Thanks to the zero-knowledge primitives of Mina, we can build a new kind of Oracle named **ZkOracle**.
A ZkOracle splits the Oracle in two parts:

- Off-chain proof: This prove that some data was fetched from a specific source, and additionally that some computation was done.
- On-chain verification: This verify the proof and the validity of the data. That data is never actually posted on-chain, but attest that "the external data used for this computation was fetched from this specific source".

ZkOracles allows to solve the problems of traditional Oracles:

- Availability: Instead of having a continous feed, users can fetch for free the data at any time during the proof generation (off-chain)
- Cooperation: A new trustless intermediary is introduced between the user and the web2 data source that analyze and sign web requests.
- Privacy: Everything is done off-chain, so the data is never posted on-chain.

In the case of the loan, the user generate a proof in which he proves that he made a HTTP request to his bank and that the response value is greater than a specific amount provided by the loan dApp.
This attest that the user has access to a bank account with more than a specific amount, without revealing the actual amount nor any private information about his bank account.
This attestation is enough for the loan dApp to ensure that the user has the required collateral while preserving the user privacy and solving the cooperation problem.
