# Milestones

## Milestone 0: Design Domain Model for ZAP

- Objective: Conceptualize and design the foundational structure of the Zero-Knowledge Attestation Protocol (ZAP), focusing on the privacy-preserving aspects and modular nature of ZAP.
- Deliverables: A detailed formalisation and a written description outlining the components and their interactions within ZAP. This documentation can be found in [ZAP Protocol](./protocol.mdx) and in [Statement](./concepts/Statement.mdx) and [Attestation](./concepts/Attestation.mdx) concepts.

## Milestone 1: ZAP Domain Model with o1js

- Objective: Develop a domain model for ZAP with o1js. This lay down the project's foundation.
- Deliverables: The ZAP Core contract and relevant types. See [ZAP Package](https://github.com/julio4/zap/tree/main/zap)

## Milestone 2: Develop Unit Tests for the ZAP Domain Model

- Objective: Ensure the reliability and functionality of each component within ZAP protocol.
- Deliverables: A comprehensive suite of unit tests covering the ZAP core contract. See [ZAP Tests](https://github.com/julio4/zap/blob/main/zap/src/Zap.test.ts)

## Milestone 3: Develop a example of a ZAP compatible Ethereum Oracle with Airstack

- Objective: The Oracle can be used as a source of truth for the ZAP protocol for Ethereum and Polygon on-chain data.
- Deliverables: Deployment of a REST API with Airstack accessible at https://zap-oracle.onrender.com/api

## Milestone 4: Develop an frontend integration example with the ZAP Ethereum Oracle

- Objective: Guarantee the overall functionality and bug-free operation of ZAP through comprehensive integration example using the ZAP Ethereum Oracle.
- Deliverables: Deployment of a frontend integration example accessible at https://mina-zap.vercel.app/

## Milestone 5: Draft Comprehensive Documentation for ZAP

- Objective: Create an extensive set of documentation for ZAP to facilitate its usage and development.
- Deliverables: The full documentation is available at [zap-docs.vercel.app](https://zap-docs.vercel.app/)

# Futur Milestones

## Recursive zk-attestation combination

- Objective: Leverage the recursive nature of zk-SNARKs to combine multiple attestations into a single zk-attestation. This will allow to reuse existing attestations to create more complex ones.

## Improve Test Coverage for ZAP

- Objective: Achieve and maintain a high level of test coverage (e.g., 80% or more) for ZAP.

## Educational Content for ZAP

- Objective: Write comprehensive guide about ZAP and its usage (Oracle implementation, frontend integration, etc.). It will be accessible from the [Guides](./guides) page.

## Attestation explorer

- Objective: Create a decentralized attestation explorer that leverage the standardization of attestations and oracles to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Npm helper package

- Objective: Provide a npm package to facilitate the integration of ZAP in other zkApps.

## Decentralized Oracle systems

- Objective: Explore and research about a decentralized oracle system to provide even more security for the end users.
