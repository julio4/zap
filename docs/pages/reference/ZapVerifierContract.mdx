# ZAP Verifier Contract

The generation of the attestation is computed off-chain in a private way in the client web-browser.
In order to make it available on-chain, the attestation need to also be verified on-chain in a transaction.

The ZAP Verifier contract is the contract that can be used for this purpose.
For further details on how exactly the attestation is verified, see the [Attestation](/concepts/Attestation#implementation) page.

## Entrypoints

### `verify`

```ts
  @method verify(attestation: Attestation): Bool {
    return attestation.isValid();
  }
```

This entrypoint is used to verify an attestation on-chain.
It return a `Bool` that is `True` if the attestation is valid, `False` otherwise.
It can be used by any contract that needs to verify an attestation on-chain (see [Callers](./Callers)).
