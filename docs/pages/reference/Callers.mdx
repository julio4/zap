# Callers contracts

Callers contracts are contracts already available that can be used to verify attestations on-chain.
Each callers will use the [Verifier Contract](./Verifier) to verify the given attestation and handle the result.

The interface `ICaller` provide the `call` entrypoint that can be used to verify an attestation on-chain:

```ts
interface ICaller {
  call(attestation: Attestation, verifierAddress: PublicKey): void;
}
```

## Implementation

A main `Caller` contract is provided and can be extended as needed:

```typescript
export class Caller extends SmartContract implements ICaller {
  @method call(attestation: Attestation, verifierAddress: PublicKey): void {
    const verifier = new Verifier(verifierAddress);
    const isVerified: Bool = verifier.verify(attestation);
    isVerified.assertTrue();
  }
}
```

## EventCaller

This caller will emit a `verifier` event when the attestation is verified:

```typescript
export class EventCaller extends SmartContract implements Caller {
  events = {
    verified: Field,
  };

  @method call(attestation: Attestation, verifierAddress: PublicKey) {
    const verifier = new Verifier(verifierAddress);
    const isVerified: Bool = verifier.verify(attestation);
    isVerified.assertTrue("Attestation is not verified.");

    this.emitEvent("verified", attestation.hash());
  }
}
```
