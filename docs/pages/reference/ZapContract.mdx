# ZAP Contract

In the ZAP zkApp, the generation of the attestation is computed off-chain in a private way in the client web-browser.
In order to make it available on-chain, the attestation need to be verified on-chain in a transaction.

The ZAP contract is the contract that allows to verify the attestation on-chain.
To enable trustless verification of the attestation,
the ZAP contract is responsible of verifying that the data used in the attestation comes from the designated trusted oracle
and that all the rules of the statement are validated.

## State

- `oraclePublicKey`: The public key of the trusted oracle

## Events

- `verified`: The specified attestation has been verified and can be considered as valid at the specified timestamp

## Entrypoints

### `verify`

```ts
@method verify(
  // The statement to attest
  conditionType: Field,
  targetValue: Field,
  // The private data attesting the statement from the trusted oracle
  hashRoute: Field,
  privateData: Field,
  // The signature that allows us to be sure that the private data are coming from our trusted oracle
  signature: Signature
);
```
