# Statement

> See the [Concepts - Attestation](/concepts/Attestation) page for more information on what is an attestation.

```typescript
type Statement = {
  sourceKey: string; // base58 of a PublicKey
  route: Route;
  condition: StatementCondition;
};
```

Each statement is linked to a [ZAP Source](/concepts/ZAPSource) by its public key `sourceKey` and is associated with a Route.

```typescript
type Route = {
  path: string;
  args?: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
};

// Example
let route: Route = {
  path: "/api/v1/price",
  args: {
    symbol: "ETH",
    currency: "USD",
  },
};
```

The `condition` is of type `StatementCondition`, and represents a rule of $\cal R$.

```typescript
type StatementCondition = {
  type: ConditionType;
  targetValue: number;
};

enum ConditionType {
  LT = 1,
  GT = 2,
  EQ = 3,
  NEQ = 4,
}

// Example
let condition = {
  type: ConditionType.GT,
  targetValue: 3000,
};
```

With the above example, the statement is equivalent to the following:

```typescript
let statement = {
  sourceKey: "base58PublicKey", // base58 of the public key of the Price Oracle ZAP Source
  route: {
    path: "/api/v1/price",
    args: {
      symbol: "ETH",
      currency: "USD",
    },
  },
  condition: {
    type: ConditionType.GT,
    targetValue: 3000,
  },
};
```

> Note: With this implementation, only statement with $n = 1, \operatorname{card}(V) = \operatorname{card}(\cal R) = 1$ can be represented.
> We plan to use recursion and '[Combining statements](/concepts/Attestation#combining-attestations-and-statements-together-for-modularity-and-scalability)' to be able to represent any statement after the initial release.

### ProvableStatement

Under the hood, the client will convert this statement object to a `ProvableStatement` o1js's struct object, and the condition will be verified inside a proof (the 'Attestation proof').
This can be easily done with the following code:

```typescript
let provableStatement = ProvableStatement.from(statement);
```
