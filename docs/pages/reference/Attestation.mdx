# Attestation

As explained in the [Concepts - Attestation](/concepts/Attestation) part, the attestation is the proof that corresponds to verifying the truth value of a statement.
The attestation is then represented as a o1js's struct object.

```typescript
interface IAttestation {
  // Return the attestation Poseidon hash
  hash(): Field;
  // Assert that the given hash is equal to the attestation hash
  assertEqual(hash: Field): void;
  // Check if the signature is valid
  isValidSignature(): Bool;
  // Assert that the signature is valid
  assertValidSignature(): void;
  // Check if the condition is valid
  isValidCondition: () => Bool;
  // Assert that the condition is valid
  assertValidCondition: () => void;
  // Check if the attestation is valid (signature and condition)
  isValid(): Bool;
  // Assert that the attestation is valid (signature and condition)
  assertValid(): void;
}

export class Attestation
  extends Struct({
    statement: ProvableStatement,
    privateData: Field,
    signature: Signature,
    address: PublicKey,
  })
  implements IAttestation {
  // ...
}
```

The `Attestation` struct contains:

- the `statement` field as a [ProvableStatement](./Statement#provablestatement)
- the `address` field as a `PublicKey` of the mina account that attests the statement
- the `privateData` field as a `Field` that contains the private data of the attestation
- the `signature` field as a `Signature` that is the signature of the privateData by the source (`statement.source`)

Here's an example of how to create an attestation:

```typescript
let sourceKey = "base58PublicKey"; // base58 of the public key of the Price Oracle ZAP Source
let statement = {
  sourceKey,
  route: {
    path: "/api/v1/price",
    args: {
      symbol: "ETH",
      currency: "USD",
    },
  },
  condition: {
    type: ConditionType.GT,
    targetValue: 3000,
  },
};

// This should be returned by the Price Oracle ZAP Source
let { signature, privateData } = {
  signature: Signature.create(sourcePrivateKey, Field(3500)),
  privateData: 3500,
};

let attestation = new Attestation({
  statement,
  privateData,
  signature,
  address: "base58PublicKey", // base58 of the public key of the attester
});
```

For an attestation to be valid, there's two steps to verify:

- The signature of the private data comes from the designated source (`isValidSignature`)
- All the rules of the statement are validated (`isValidCondition`)

We can use the `isValid` method to check if the attestation is valid.
Each methods of `Attestation` are fully o1js circuits, so attestation can be used in smart contracts as well!

```typescript
console.log(attestation.isValid()); // true
```
