# Test locally

This project is using pnmp as a package manager. You can install it with:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

After that, you can run the following commands:

- Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/julio4/zap.git
```

- Install package dependencies using pnpm

```sh
pnpm i
```

- Build the project

```sh
pnpm build
```

You can run the smart contract tests locally:

```sh
cd zap/ && npm run build && npm run test
```

You can also run the dApp locally. It will be available at http://localhost:3000/

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

_note: If you got an error because the port 3030 is already in use, you can check which process is using it with `lsof -i :3030` and then `kill -9 <PID>`_
