#### ZAP Source

Currently, HTTP requests inside a proof is **NOT-SUPPORTED** by Mina.

We need a workaround: The *ZAP Sources*! They are a subset of the possible sources that can be used during the off-chain proof generation.
Source only refers to the HTTP endpoints used to fetch the data.

Zap Sources are web2 API. They expose endpoints that wraps specific HTTP requests and gets the result on behalf of the user.
The response is signed with a pair of keys.

This allow the user to make the HTTP request in an unsafe environment (outside of the proof) and use the response inside the proof.
During the verification, the ZAP Source public key is used to verify the signature of the response, thus emulating an HTTP request inside a proof.

Following the loan example, a `Bank` ZAP Source is deployed. The user makes a HTTP request to this source with his bank authentification token.
The ZAP source relays the request to the bank, and send back the response signed with its private key.
The user generate a proof that he has more than a specific amount on his bank account using the value returned by the source, and the proof is verified on-chain against the source public key.

> This is the only part where there is a privacy issue: The ZAP Source can see the user's bank account balance and authentification token. 
> We are researching a solution to this problem and open to suggestions/ideas!
