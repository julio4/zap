# Overview

ZAP is the first Zero-Knowledge Attestation Protocol built on Mina. It's a **module-based**, **scalable** and **intuitive** protocol that enables developers to build privacy-preserving applications on Mina.

### What is a Zero-Knowledge Attestation ?

To fully understand what is the goal behind ZAP, we need to understand what is a statement, an attestation, and a zero-knowledge proof.

- [Statement](./definitions/Statement): a logical expression that contains one or more variables and that can be either true or false.
- [Attestation](./definitions/Attestation): the truth value of a statement when all the variables are given a value.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a novel type of cryptographic proofs that have two components: a **prover** and a **verifier**.
The prover generate a proof based on both private and public inputs, and the verifier is able to verify the validity of the proof based on the public inputs only.

We can directly see the use case of zero-knowledge proofs in the context of attestations: the user wants to prove that a statement is true, i.e. create an attestation, but without revealing all the variables values, and the verifier is the end-application that wants to use the attestation to verify the truth value of the statement.
This is a significant steps in the direction of privacy-preserving applications, and this is what ZAP and Mina is all about!

### What is Zap?

The main idea behind ZAP is to allow developers to easily create zero-knowledge attestations on Mina based on any kind of data with minimal effort and maximum flexibility.
ZAP want to abstract the complexity of handling private data during the generation of the attestation and the verification of the proof while ensuring that the logic rules are respected in a transparent way.

This way developers can focus on the logic rules of the statement and let ZAP handle the rest.

ZAP abstract the logic of the creation/validation of statements/attestations and the data sources used to get the value of the variables of the statements.

**Data sources** refers to what is used to get the value of the variables of the statement, it can be on-chain data, off-chain data, or even user input.
ZAP provides a default EVM data source using `Airstack` as a demonstration, but developers are free to implement and use their own data sources.
Data sources are always considered as trusted, so it's the developer's responsibility to ensure that the data source is reliable and inform its users about the source used.

### Use cases

ZAP can be used in many different use cases, and while we provides some examples here, we are more than excited to see what you will build with it!
The main idea to keep in mind is that ZAP allow you to verify some kind of information about your users in a privacy-preserving way.

#### On-chain data

ZAP can be used to attest the validity of on-chain data.

- Proof of holding
- Proof of profit
- Proof of activity
- Proof of ownership (ERC20, ERC721, etc.)
- ... 

We are developing a demo data source using `Airstack` to bring Ethereum data on Mina, and more data sources examples will be added in the near future.

#### Off-chain data

ZAP can be used to attest the validity of private off-chain data.
Using email signatures, API keys, authentication tokens, etc. ZAP can be used to attest the validity of any kind of off-chain data.

#### Decentralized identity

ZAP can be used to attest the validity of a user's identity. The user can then use this attestation to prove that he is who he claims to be without revealing any sensitive information.
This coupled with web2 off-chain identity providers can be used to build sybil-resistant decentralized applications, reputation systems, proof of humanity, etc.

## Project status

Currently, ZAP is **in-development** and should not be used in production.
